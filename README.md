# Fine-Tuning LLM for Code Style Analysis

This repository contains the source code and resources for the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning LLM for Code Style
Analysis: An Approach Augmented with DFA". Study explores the integration of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) into
the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B models.

The primary objective is to improve the models' accuracy in distinguishing between PEP-8 compliant and non-compliant
code indentation, particularly under conditions of limited training data.
